Home Temperature and Humidity Insights

Overview: 
This dashboard provides a real-time analysis of my home temperature and humidity trends over time. It helps in identifying temperature variations, humidity levels, and potential correlations between the two.
Key insights from the Data
Temperature Ranges & Trends:
•	The minimum recorded temperature is 63.32°F, while the maximum recorded temperature is 73.94°F.
•	The average temperature is around 63.32°F, indicating a relatively stable indoor climate.
•	Temperature follows a fluctuating pattern, with noticeable dips around early morning hours (~4 AM).
Humidity Levels & Patterns:
•	The average humidity is 52.37%, with values ranging from 48% to 54%.
•	Humidity tends to increase in the morning, peaking around 10 AM before stabilizing.
Temperature & Humidity Correlation:
•	The temperature and humidity trends show an inverse relationship, where temperature decreases while humidity increases in certain timeframes.
•	This suggests that cooler indoor conditions might be associated with higher humidity levels (potentially due to HVAC systems, weather, or ventilation patterns).
Time-Based Variations:
•	Temperature drops significantly around 4 AM, reaching its lowest point at 63.3°F before recovering later in the morning.
•	Humidity follows an opposite pattern, decreasing early in the morning and rising steadily after 6 AM.
•	These patterns could indicate the impact of nighttime cooling and daily temperature cycles.


Potential Actions & Recommendations
•	Optimize HVAC Settings – If temperature fluctuations are undesirable, adjusting the thermostat schedule can help maintain a more consistent indoor climate.
•	Monitor Humidity Trends – If high humidity levels persist in the morning, it may be beneficial to adjust ventilation or use a dehumidifier to maintain comfort.
